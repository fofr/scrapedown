A bookmarkelet to glean the contents of a web page as markdown.

Includes code derived from the original [Readability bookmarklet](https://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/), released under the Apache 2.0 licence.

Uses [domchristie/to-markdown](https://github.com/domchristie/to-markdown) to convert the simplified HTML into Markdown.

Guess the goal should be to smoosh this code together, eventually.
