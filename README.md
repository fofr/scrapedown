A bookmarkelet to glean the contents of a web page as markdown.

Try it out from http://psd.github.com/scrapedown

There are other [similar things](http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/) out there, but this aims to be open source and run client-side.

Includes code derived from the original [Readability bookmarklet](https://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/), released under the Apache 2.0 licence.

The preview pane uses the [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) markdown parser, which was released under a MIT licence.

## Caveats
* Currently doesn't work with https pages (needs https hosting for the scripts).
